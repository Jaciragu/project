        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Jacindha, and I am currently a third-year college student
            pursuing a degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering
            at Sri Krishna College of Engineering and Technology.
            I am passionate about web development and problem solving,and
            I am dedicated to developing my skills and knowledge in this area.
            During my time in college, I have been actively involved in participating in
            hackathons,ideathons and project expos.These experiences have not only allowed
            me to explore different aspects but have also honed my teamwork, leadership,
            and communication skills. I have completed coursework in web development,
            where I have gained a solid theoretical foundation.Moreover, I have also
            undertaken internships that have provided me with practical insights and
            real-world problem-solving skills.</p>

            <h2>Designed an ML model for Autism Spectrum Disorder</h2>
            <p>
                I am proud to have designed a machine learning (ML) model focused on Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), a project that combines my passion for technology with a strong desire to make a positive impact. This project involved extensive research and data analysis to develop an innovative solution that can aid in the early detection and intervention of ASD. By leveraging advanced algorithms and cutting-edge technology, my model aims to provide more accurate and timely diagnoses.</p>

            <h2>Driver Drowsiness Detector</h2>
            <p>I am proud to share that I developed an innovative Internet of Things (IoT) model for a Driver Drowsiness Detector. This project combines my expertise in technology with a commitment to enhancing road safety. By integrating sensors and real-time data processing, the model monitors driver alertness and detects signs of drowsiness. The system then alerts the driver, reducing the risk of accidents caused by fatigue.</p>
